# kegnet-thermistor-photon
A thermistor library for Particle (Spark) Photon
Based on Adafruit Thermistor documentation at https://learn.adafruit.com/thermistor/using-a-thermistor

Most other thermistor libraries assume the maximum alalogRead value is 1023, but
the Photon's maximum analogRead value is 4095!

This library uses the simplied version of the Steinhartâ€“Hart equation described in the
Adafruit with full configuration of the required variables as constructor parameters.

For an NTC (negative temperature coefficient) thermistor only!

CONSTRUCTOR PARAMETERS:
1: Photon PIN
2: The resistance value of the fixed resistor (based on your hardware setup)
3: The maximum analog-to-digital convert value returned by analogRead (Photon is 4095 NOT the typical Arduino 1023!)
4: Resistance at nominal temperature (will be documented with the thermistor, usually "10k")
5: Temperature for nominal resistance in celcius (will be supplied with the thermistor, assume 25 if not stated)
6: Beta coefficient of the thermistor; usually 3435 or 3950 (will be documented with the thermistor)
7: Number of analog samples to average (for smoothing)
8: Milliseconds between analog samples (for smoothing)
